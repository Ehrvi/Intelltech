# Archives Directory

This directory is for storing completed projects, old versions of files, and other historical data. It serves as a record of past work and a source of lessons learned.

## Structure

Files in this directory should be organized into subdirectories named by date and project, for example:

```
/archives/
├── 2026-02-14_Strategic_Report_v1/
│   ├── report_draft.md
│   └── market_data_raw.csv
└── 2026-01-20_Lead_Gen_Experiment/
    └── old_worker_scripts/
```

**Usage:** At the end of every task, move all intermediate files, drafts, and raw data into a new, dated folder within this directory. This keeps the main university directories clean and focused on current, validated, current knowledge.
