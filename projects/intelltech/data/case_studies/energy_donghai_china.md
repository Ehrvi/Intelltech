**Project Details:**
- Location: Donghai Bridge wind farm, East China Sea, China
- Type: Offshore wind farm with new fixed structure foundation
- Foundation: High-rise pile cap foundation with cap supported by eight steel piles
- Monitoring Period: From 1948 to 2013, with detailed monitoring during typhoons
- Mean water level: 0.23 m
- Design tide currents and wave parameters documented for 50-year and 100-year return periods

**Monitoring System:**
- Structural strain monitoring instruments installed on four steel piles and in the cap
- Clinometers installed to monitor tilt angles
- Real-time in-situ measurements of wind speed and wave height
- Measurements of stresses on piles and cap
- Inclination of tower monitoring
- Comprehensive monitoring during typhoon events

**Key Findings:**
- The new fixed structure demonstrated good bearing capacity during typhoon events
- Met operational safety requirements under extreme conditions
- Relationship between wind conditions and tower inclination was characterized
- Validated the safety of the new structure during typhoon Haikui
- Mean water level in the area is about 12 m
- Average sea level is 0.23 m (Table 1)
- Characteristics of the tide level between 1948 and 2013 analyzed

**IntellTech Synergy:**
- SHMS Platform: Would provide comprehensive real-time monitoring of foundation stability, structural integrity, and environmental conditions (wind, wave, tilt) - exactly the type of monitoring implemented in this project
- Typhoon Resilience: SHMS automated alerts during extreme weather events would enable proactive response and safety verification
- Foundation Monitoring: IntellTech's expertise in foundation settlement and structural deformation monitoring directly applicable to offshore wind turbine foundations
- Long-term Asset Management: SHMS continuous monitoring supports predictive maintenance and extends asset lifespan
- Geo Inspector Integration: Manual inspections using Geo Inspector would complement SHMS for visual verification of structural integrity, corrosion assessment, and maintenance documentation
- Renewable Energy Market: Demonstrates strong market opportunity in Asia-Pacific offshore wind sector, particularly in China, Taiwan, Vietnam, and emerging markets
- Multi-hazard Monitoring: SHMS capability to integrate geotechnical, structural, and environmental monitoring aligns perfectly with offshore wind farm requirements
- Regulatory Compliance: Automated compliance reporting for multiple international standards (DNV, IEC, API) - a key SHMS feature
