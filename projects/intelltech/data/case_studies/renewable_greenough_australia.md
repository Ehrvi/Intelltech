**Project Details:**
Location: Near Geraldton, Western Australia
Capacity: 12.68 MWDC, 10.00 MWAC (initial installation)
Expansion Plan: First planned expansion to 40.00 MWAC in 2019
Type: Large Photovoltaic Solar Power Plant (LPVPP)
Study Period: 2013-2017 (5 years of operational data)

**Project Significance:**
This research paper presents the first specific validation and verification study of the Greenough River Solar Farm. The project is significant as a case study for the design and investment modeling of renewable power grids, which is the success key for a 100% renewable power Global Grid. The Australian continent has outstanding solar resource availability, enabling widespread utilization of solar power and power storage technologies (pumped hydroelectric, thermal, electrochemical).

**Technical Validation:**
The study validated the solar farm performance using PVWatts Version 5 model of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) System Advisor Model (SAM) Version 2017.9.5. NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA-2) datasets were used as weather data source. The Greenough River Solar Farm NREL SAM software models were run on 2 different personal computers with internet connection for years 2013 to 2017.

**Performance Results:**
The simulations average total time was 64.1 and 77.9 milliseconds. The best model-to-actual accuracy measure achieved was 101.9%. The minimum root mean square error (RMSE) was 254.142 MWh in 2013. The maximum RMSE was 414.931 MWh in 2014. Results of 6 simple simulations were compared with actual generation data for 2013 through 2017 with statistical performance measures of the global unique forecast accuracy metrics pool in the Global Grid Prediction Systems (G2PS).

**Design Philosophy:**
The design and investment in Large Photovoltaic Solar Power Plants (LPVPPs) and Very Large Photovoltaic Solar Power Plants (VLPVPPs) should preferably be undertaken with consideration of values such as environmental friendliness, fairness, openness to small private investors, reliability, and accountability. The design of LPVPPs and VLPVPPs should preferably be based on some small-scale PV power plants to help reduce the risks for large to very large investments. Hence, validation and verification efforts of operational PV power plants with different design software are very important for the solar industry.

**IntellTech Synergy:**
SHMS Platform would provide comprehensive real-time monitoring of solar farm ground stability, foundation settlement, and structural integrity of mounting systems - critical parameters not addressed by energy production monitoring alone. IntellTech's expertise in ground movement monitoring directly applicable to large-scale solar farms where soil settlement or erosion can damage panels and mounting structures. The combination of SHMS automated geotechnical monitoring with Geo Inspector manual inspections would provide complete operational risk intelligence for solar farms. Australia case demonstrates strong Asia-Pacific market for renewable energy infrastructure monitoring, with similar opportunities in India, Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, and Indonesia where solar capacity is rapidly expanding. SHMS could integrate geotechnical monitoring (ground settlement, erosion, slope stability) with structural monitoring (mounting system integrity, panel alignment) in a unified platform for comprehensive solar farm asset management. The 5-year operational history demonstrates market need for long-term monitoring solutions - a key SHMS value proposition. Automated alert systems for ground movement, foundation settlement, or structural deformation would enable proactive maintenance and prevent costly downtime. The planned expansion from 10 MWAC to 40 MWAC validates the scalability requirements that SHMS platform is designed to support. Market opportunity extends to wind farms, geothermal plants, and other renewable energy infrastructure requiring geotechnical and structural monitoring across Asia-Pacific region.
