**Project Details:**
Project Name: Korail project network
Client: Korea Network Authority
Scale: Over 100 accelerometers and 65 digitisers at 34 seismic stations over 320 km of railway line
Technology: Güralp strong-motion accelerometers with real-time data transmission
Purpose: Earthquake early warning system for high-speed railway infrastructure

**Summary:**
The Korail project network was formed by the Korea Network Authority to provide low-latency data for an early warning system. The solution consists of over 100 accelerometers and 65 digitisers distributed across 34 stations over 320 km of railway line. Each station contains two 5T tri-axial accelerometers connected to the network using DM24 digitizers and data modules.

**Güralp Solution:**
The Korail project network consists of over 100 accelerometers and 65 digitisers spread at regular intervals over 320 km of railway line. Güralp strong-motion accelerometers gather real-time data from structures along the newly-built high-speed railway line and transmit it to operators using a combination of Scream and GSMS protocols. GSMS can provide every second and on triggered data MMA (minimum, maximum and average ground acceleration), PGA (Peak Ground Acceleration), RMS (Root Mean Square), Cross correlation and SI (Spectral Intensity).

**Technical Implementation:**
A minimum of two accelerometers are used: one at the bottom of the column, one at the top. The instruments are connected to a single 6-channel DM24 mk3 digitizer in a nearby building, which is linked to the local TCP/IP network with a DCM. The DCM runs a Scream server so that real-time data can be viewed from anywhere on the network. Only one of the two digitizer input ports on each DCM is used, giving the array scope for future expansion as necessary.

**Key Features:**
Real-time monitoring of seismic activity and structural response
Low-latency data transmission for earthquake early warning
Comprehensive coverage over 320 km of high-speed railway infrastructure
Scalable architecture with expansion capability
Integration with national earthquake monitoring network

**IntellTech Synergy:**
SHMS Platform would provide similar comprehensive real-time monitoring for railway infrastructure but with broader geotechnical capabilities beyond seismic monitoring alone. IntellTech's expertise in embankment stability, track foundation monitoring, and tunnel integrity assessment directly complements seismic monitoring systems. The combination of SHMS automated monitoring with Geo Inspector manual inspections would provide complete operational risk intelligence for railway networks. South Korea case demonstrates strong Asia-Pacific market for railway infrastructure monitoring, with similar opportunities in Japan, India, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia where high-speed rail projects are expanding. SHMS could integrate seismic data with geotechnical monitoring (embankment deformation, tunnel convergence, track settlement) in a unified platform for comprehensive railway safety management. Automated alert systems for multiple hazard types (seismic, geotechnical, structural) align with SHMS core capabilities. The scalable architecture and real-time data transmission requirements match SHMS platform design principles.
