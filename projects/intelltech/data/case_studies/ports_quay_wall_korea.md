**Challenge:**
Structural monitoring of quay walls is essential where various events occur due to unexpected high waves, vessels, and heavy equipment. However, real-time events cannot be constantly monitored by on-site personnel. Port structures are particularly vulnerable compared to standard inland counterparts due to unique environmental conditions. The presence of saline substances in coastal environments hastens the deterioration of materials, especially concrete and steel. Additionally, unexpected high waves and irregular impact or friction forces induced by vessel berthing can further weaken these structures. Climate change challenges the ability of port structures to endure throughout their lifespan.

**Traditional Limitations:**
Visual inspection has traditionally been employed as a fundamental method, performed periodically every three to six months to detect damage such as cracks and exfoliation. However, visual inspections are often inconsistent, labor-intensive, and influenced by subjective judgment. Direct access to underwater areas for inspection can be hazardous and is frequently hindered by turbid water and shells adhering to the surface. These visual inspection methods are inadequate for detecting damage immediately after it occurs, and structural safety is assessed solely based on the severity of damage observed afterward.

**Innovative Solution:**
This study proposes an innovative AI-powered, cloud-based wireless sensor system that incorporates a high-sensitivity accelerometer with an ultra-low noise level of 0.003 mg, designed to monitor the low response amplitude of massive quay walls. The sensor can be activated by a scheduled trigger or a long-range finder. Vessel detection is performed utilizing the AI-based object detection method, Faster R-CNN, which employs ResNet as the backbone network. The detected anchor box's position and dimensions are subsequently processed to confirm the presence of a berthing vessel.

**Technical Specifications:**
- High-sensitivity accelerometer with ultra-low noise level of 0.003 mg
- Designed to monitor low response amplitude of massive quay walls
- Scheduled trigger or long-range finder activation
- AI-based vessel detection using Faster R-CNN with ResNet backbone
- Real-time data transmission via LTE communication to cloud server
- Multisensory data collection: acceleration, tilt, temperature, camera images

**Implementation and Results:**
The developed system was installed on a caisson-type quay wall in Korea, where acceleration, tilt, temperature, and camera image data were analyzed to assess its performance for real-time event monitoring. The results demonstrated that the safety of quay walls can be automatically managed by monitoring events during berthing and mooring with the proposed system. The collected data are transmitted wirelessly to a proposed cloud server through LTE communication in real-time.

**Significance:**
The integration of machine learning, deep learning, and advanced optimization techniques has led to more sophisticated methods for detecting structural damage, even in complex and dynamic environments. This advancement demonstrates the growing integration of various technologies in the field of vibration-based structural health monitoring (SHM). The system addresses the chronic limitation of visual inspection methods by enabling immediate damage detection after it occurs.

**IntellTech Synergy:**
SHMS Platform would provide similar comprehensive real-time monitoring but with broader geotechnical capabilities beyond structural monitoring alone. IntellTech's expertise in multi-parameter monitoring (acceleration, tilt, temperature, displacement) directly applicable to quay wall and port infrastructure. The combination of SHMS automated monitoring with Geo Inspector manual inspections would provide complete operational risk intelligence for port facilities. South Korea case validates Asia-Pacific port infrastructure market opportunity for IntellTech's monitoring solutions. SHMS could integrate structural health monitoring with geotechnical monitoring (foundation settlement, soil liquefaction, scour detection) in a unified platform for comprehensive port safety management. The AI-based vessel detection and automated event monitoring aligns with SHMS intelligent data analytics capabilities. Real-time cloud-based data transmission via LTE communication matches SHMS platform architecture. Market opportunity extends to other Asia-Pacific countries with major port infrastructure (Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, Japan). The caisson-type quay wall monitoring demonstrates SHMS applicability to diverse port structure types. Automated alert systems for multiple hazard types (berthing impact, high waves, structural deformation, foundation issues) align with SHMS core capabilities. The ultra-low noise accelerometer requirement (0.003 mg) validates the need for high-precision sensors that SHMS platform can integrate. Climate change resilience monitoring addresses growing market need for adaptive infrastructure management.
