**Project Details:**
- **Location:** Cadia Mine, New South Wales, Australia
- **Operator:** Newcrest Mining Ltd.
- **Incident Date:** 9 March 2018 - localised TSF (Tailings Storage Facility) failure
- **Monitoring Technology:** Satellite InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) for remote monitoring

**Key Findings:**
- Low-magnitude subsidence signals were observed across the TSF dam during the year preceding the collapse
- In January 2018, a notable change in behavior was observed with concentrated subsidence in the region that failed on 9 March 2018
- Post-collapse InSAR measurements showed increased rate of subsidence for regions either side of the failure zone
- The failure was phased, with an initial failure and subsequent failure at least two days after 9 March 2018

**Significance:**
- Demonstrates the critical importance of continuous monitoring of tailings dams
- Shows that early warning signals were detectable months before the failure
- Highlights the need for real-time automated monitoring systems to detect behavioral changes

**IntellTech Synergy:**
- **SHMS Platform:** Would provide real-time automated monitoring of dam stability, pore water pressure, and deformation - exactly what was needed to detect the January 2018 behavioral change immediately
- **Early Warning System:** SHMS automated alerts could have triggered immediate investigation when subsidence patterns changed in January 2018, potentially preventing the March 2018 failure
- **GISTM Compliance:** IntellTech's expertise in GISTM (Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management) compliance positions it as ideal partner for Australian mining companies post-Cadia incident
- **Geo Inspector Integration:** Manual inspections using Geo Inspector would complement SHMS automated monitoring, providing visual verification and detailed documentation
- **Risk Mitigation:** The Cadia case demonstrates the catastrophic cost of inadequate monitoring - IntellTech's dual-product solution (SHMS + Geo Inspector) provides comprehensive risk management
- **Market Opportunity:** Post-Cadia, Australian mining industry has heightened awareness of tailings dam risks, creating strong market demand for advanced monitoring solutions

**Regulatory Context:**
- This incident reinforced the need for compliance with international standards like GISTM
- Australian mining companies are now under increased scrutiny for tailings dam safety
- Real-time monitoring is becoming a regulatory requirement, not just best practice
