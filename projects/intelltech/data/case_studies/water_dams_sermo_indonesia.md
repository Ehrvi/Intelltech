**Conference:** FIG Working Week 2012 - Knowing to manage the territory, protect the environment, evaluate the cultural heritage

**Project Details:**
Location: Sermo Dam, Java Island, Yogyakarta Province, Indonesia
Operational Since: 1996
Status: One of critical dams in Indonesia (Azdan dan Samekto, 2008)
Challenge: Suspected to suffer from deformation caused by earthquake, requiring urgent monitoring
Country Context: Indonesia has built more than 284 large and small dams, many not in good condition in terms of safety, service function, operation and maintenance

**Geological Context:**
Indonesia is an archipelago located on the Eurasian plate (subduction zone) where three major tectonic plates meet: Indo-Australian plate (south and west), Pacific plate (north and east), and Eurasian plate. This creates the "Ring of Fire" with a chain of active and dormant volcanoes spreading along Sumatra, Java, Bali, Lombok, Sulawesi. Dam deformation is possibly caused by reduction or increasing enhancement, earthquake, sliding, three-dimensional position, cracks, shifting, high-low water level, seepage or leakage.

**Monitoring System Design:**
A geodetic and hydrological engineering system was designed to detect displacements in Sermo dam using multi sensors permanently installed:

1. **RTS (Robotic Total Station) sensor** - array of permanently mounted prisms
2. **GNSS CORS sensors** - two units installed using two towers
   - First tower: base station (SRM1) at Intake Sermo Dam
   - Second tower: back sight station (SRM2) at upstream of Sermo dam with one prism unit
3. **Automatic Water Level Recording (AWLR) sensor**
4. **Pan, Tilt, and Zoom digital IP Camera (CCTV)**

**Technical Specifications:**
- RTS and GNSS CORS installed at first tower
- GNSS antenna installed about 2.30 meters above RTS
- Distance between the GNSS antenna and the center of prism: about 2.10 meters
- 6 prisms at downstream slope
- 13 prisms at crest of center dam
- Keywords: RTS, prisms, GNSS CORS, AWLR, and digital IP Camera

**Risk Assessment Context:**
Expected life age of dam is generally determined by characteristics of dam structure stability, path dynamical factors (endogen, exogenous, tectonic earthquake), and dam management system. Dams are generally deformed by static and dynamic movements. Table 1 in the study shows the risk of damage to dams in Indonesia.

**IntellTech Synergy:**
SHMS Platform would provide comprehensive real-time automated monitoring similar to the multi-sensor approach at Sermo Dam but with integrated data analytics and automated alerting. IntellTech's expertise in dam safety and GISTM compliance directly applicable to Indonesia's 284+ dams requiring safety upgrades. The combination of SHMS automated monitoring with Geo Inspector manual inspections would provide complete dam safety management for Indonesia's critical infrastructure. Sermo Dam case demonstrates urgent market need in Indonesia for dam monitoring solutions due to seismic risks and aging infrastructure. SHMS could integrate geodetic monitoring (similar to RTS/GNSS), water level monitoring (AWLR), and visual inspection data (similar to CCTV but enhanced with Geo Inspector mobile capabilities) in a unified platform. Automated compliance reporting for dam safety regulations and early warning systems for earthquake-induced deformation align with SHMS core capabilities. The multi-hazard environment (seismic, volcanic, flooding) in Indonesia creates strong demand for comprehensive monitoring solutions that IntellTech can provide. Market opportunity extends beyond Indonesia to other Asia-Pacific countries with similar seismic risks and aging dam infrastructure (Philippines, Japan, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea).
