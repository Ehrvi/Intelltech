**Award:** 2021 Queens Award for Enterprise in Innovation (highest award a UK business can receive)

**Project Details:**
Location: Multiple deployments including Ormen Lange gas field (Norwegian Sea, operated by Norske Shell), Gulf of Mexico, North Sea, and offshore Malaysia
Technology: Fetch Pressure Monitoring Transponder (PMT) and Fetch AZA PMT
Monitoring Period: 2007-present (15+ years of continuous operation)
Latest Deployment: 75 instruments deployed at Ormen Lange between September 2019 and October 2020
Operational Life: 10+ years without human intervention

**The Challenge:**
Hydrocarbon production at offshore fields causes reservoir pressure reduction, leading to seabed subsidence that can trigger dangerous geohazards including earthquakes and fault slips. Some fields like Ekofisk in the North Sea have subsided by several metres with average annual rates of 10-15 cm per year. Deep-water fields in Gulf of Mexico and pre-salt fields offshore Brazil exhibit lower rates of 2-5 cm per year. The industry challenge set by Shell Geophysicist Dr Paul Hatchell in 2010 was to develop continuous seabed subsidence measurement sensitive enough to detect 1 cm per year of vertical movement at affordable cost.

**The Solution:**
Pressure-based subsidence monitoring using seabed-deployed Fetch PMT instruments with highly accurate pressure sensors, data logging electronics, wireless acoustic communications, and 10+ years battery life. Programmable intervals from minutes to hours for continuous measurement of seabed pressure, ambient temperature, unit inclination, and sample time. Data harvested wirelessly using Uncrewed Surface Vehicles (USVs) at 3-9 month intervals, significantly reducing cost and CO2 emissions compared to crewed vessels.

**Key Innovation - Drift Compensation:**
Three interrelated techniques to address pressure sensor drift: pre-screening and drift rate measurement before deployment with compensation adjustments, patented Ambient-Zero-Ambient (AZA) method for in-situ recalibration without recovery, and GPS Acoustic Box-in (GPS-A) for absolute 3D position measurement to calibrate pressure sensor data.

**Results:**
High accuracy (circa 1 cm per year) continuous seabed subsidence monitoring is now an industry-recognized technique. Several discrete subsidence events (sudden depth changes) have been detected, providing critical geohazard information to reservoir engineers. Geophysicists routinely use the data to reduce uncertainty in reservoir models and aid decision-making for proactive reservoir management. Field-wide deployments across North Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Norwegian Sea, and offshore Malaysia have been successful.

**Cost and Environmental Benefits:**
Routine use of USVs instead of ships for data collection has reduced costs, CO2 emissions, and human offshore exposure. Technology has also been transferred to Ocean Science applications for monitoring plate tectonics, subduction zones, and submerged volcano sides.

**IntellTech Synergy:**
SHMS Platform would provide comprehensive real-time subsidence monitoring similar to Fetch PMT but integrated with broader geotechnical and structural monitoring capabilities. IntellTech's expertise in ground movement monitoring and automated alert systems directly applicable to offshore oil and gas subsidence management. The combination of SHMS automated monitoring with Geo Inspector manual inspections would provide complete operational risk intelligence for offshore platforms and pipeline corridors. Market validation in offshore Malaysia demonstrates strong Asia-Pacific opportunity for IntellTech's monitoring solutions in the oil and gas sector. SHMS could integrate subsidence data with platform structural integrity monitoring, pipeline corridor surveillance, and environmental compliance reporting in a unified platform. Automated compliance reporting for geohazard management and reservoir engineering decision support aligns with SHMS core capabilities. The 10-year operational requirement demonstrates market demand for long-term, low-maintenance monitoring solutions - a key SHMS value proposition.
