**Project Type:** Infrastructure tunnel monitoring
**Country:** Singapore
**Industry:** Infrastructure
**Products Used:** Ackcio Gateway (BEAM-GW), Ackcio Analogue Nodes (BEAM-AN-SI)

**Key Details:**
- Real-time monitoring of MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) tunnelling project
- Challenge: CST (Cross Service Tunnel) had to be monitored during construction to ensure nearby jacking and digging work did not compromise stability and safety
- Soil monitoring during excavation and construction activities
- Real-time automated monitoring system implementation

**IntellTech Synergy:**
- Similar to SHMS automated real-time monitoring capabilities
- Demonstrates market need for automated geotechnical monitoring in Singapore infrastructure projects
- IntellTech's SHMS + Geo Inspector combination would provide both automated monitoring (SHMS) and manual inspection capabilities (Geo Inspector) for comprehensive tunnel safety management
- Validates the construction sector opportunity in Singapore for geotechnical monitoring solutions
