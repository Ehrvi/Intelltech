# P1: Always Study First - ENFORCED

## Prime Directive
**Study comprehensively BEFORE taking action. Never act on assumptions.**

---

## MANDATORY STUDY SEQUENCE

### Before EVERY Task
```
1. Read existing knowledge base
2. Search Anna's Archive for papers
3. Use OpenAI for synthesis (if needed)
4. Cross-reference multiple sources
5. THEN act
```

---

## ENFORCEMENT RULES

### BLOCKING Violations
These will **BLOCK** the operation:

1. ❌ Acting without checking existing knowledge
2. ❌ Not using Anna's Archive for research
3. ❌ Single source without cross-reference
4. ❌ Assumptions without validation
5. ❌ Skipping scientific method

---

## STUDY CHECKLIST

### Step 1: Check Local Knowledge ✅
```bash
# Search existing knowledge base
grep -r "topic" /home/ubuntu/manus_global_knowledge/docs/
```

**If found:** Use it! (FREE)
**If not found:** Continue to Step 2

### Step 2: Anna's Archive ✅
```
1. Navigate to Anna's Archive
2. Search for academic papers
3. Download relevant papers (3-5 minimum)
4. Read and extract insights
5. Cite properly
```

**Required for:** Research, knowledge creation, scientific claims

### Step 3: OpenAI Synthesis (Optional) ✅
```
Use OpenAI to:
- Synthesize multiple sources
- Generate structured knowledge
- Create frameworks
```

**Only after:** Steps 1-2 completed

### Step 4: Cross-Reference ✅
```
Minimum sources:
- Simple topics: 3 sources
- Medium topics: 5 sources
- Complex topics: 10+ sources
```

### Step 5: Apply Scientific Method ✅
```
1. Observe
2. Question
3. Hypothesize
4. Predict
5. Test
6. Analyze
7. Conclude
8. Communicate
9. Replicate
10. Peer Review
11. Theory Building
12. Application
```

## STUDY DEPTH BY TASK TYPE

### Quick Tasks (<5 min)
- Check local knowledge
- 1-2 sources minimum
- Basic validation

### Medium Tasks (5-30 min)
- Check local + Anna's Archive
- 3-5 sources
- Cross-reference
- Scientific method (simplified)

### Deep Tasks (>30 min)
- Comprehensive research
- 10+ sources
- Full scientific method
- Peer review (Guardian)

---

## KNOWLEDGE SOURCES (Priority Order)

1. **Local Knowledge Base** (FREE, instant)
   - `/home/ubuntu/manus_global_knowledge/docs/`
   - Existing research
   - Templates

2. **Anna's Archive** (FREE, high quality)
   - Academic papers
   - Books
   - Research publications

3. **OpenAI** ($$, synthesis)
   - Multi-source synthesis
   - Framework generation
   - Structured output

4. **Web Search** (FREE, variable quality)
   - Current information
   - News
   - Documentation

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS

### ❌ DON'T DO THIS
1. Act without studying
2. Rely on single source
3. Skip Anna's Archive for research
4. Make assumptions
5. Ignore existing knowledge
6. No cross-referencing
7. Skip scientific method
8. No citations

### ✅ DO THIS INSTEAD
1. Study first, act second
2. Multiple sources always
3. Use Anna's Archive for papers
4. Validate everything
5. Check local knowledge first
6. Cross-reference thoroughly
7. Apply scientific method
8. Cite all sources

---

## COMPLIANCE

### How to Check
```bash
# Check if knowledge was studied
ls -la /home/ubuntu/manus_global_knowledge/docs/reference/

# Check citations in output
grep -E "\[.*\]\(.*\)" output.md
```

### Expected
- Local knowledge checked: YES
- Anna's Archive used: YES (for research)
- Multiple sources: YES (≥3)
- Citations present: YES
- Scientific method applied: YES

---

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Design Research
```
Task: "Study design principles"

✅ Correct Approach:
1. Check local: /docs/reference/design/
2. Anna's Archive: "design principles psychology"
3. Download 5 papers
4. Read and extract
5. OpenAI: Synthesize insights
6. Cross-reference
7. Create knowledge doc with citations

❌ Wrong Approach:
1. Ask OpenAI directly
2. Use single response
3. No citations
4. No validation
```

### Example 2: Cost Optimization
```
Task: "Optimize costs"

✅ Correct Approach:
1. Check local: cost_optimization_mastery.md
2. Anna's Archive: "AI cost optimization", "caching strategies"
3. Download papers
4. Extract techniques
5. Validate with data
6. Apply + cite

❌ Wrong Approach:
1. Guess techniques
2. No research
3. No validation
4. No citations
```

## INTEGRATION WITH OTHER PRINCIPLES

### P1 + P2 (Study + Decide)
```
Study first → Understand deeply → Decide autonomously
```

### P1 + P3 (Study + Cost)
```
Study efficiently → Use cache → Optimize cost
```

### P1 + P4 (Study + Quality)
```
Study thoroughly → Apply best practices → Ensure quality
```

### P1 + P5 (Study + Report)
```
Study completely → Document findings → Report accurately
```

---

## VIOLATIONS = BLOCKING

**If P1 is violated:**
- Operation will be BLOCKED
- Must study first
- Then retry

**No exceptions.**
