## 🎯 INTEGRATION WITH OPERATING SYSTEM V2.0

**This protocol is now part of the unified MANUS OPERATING SYSTEM V2.0.**

**Primary Source:** `/home/ubuntu/manus_global_knowledge/MANUS_OPERATING_SYSTEM.md`

**This document provides detailed implementation guidance for:**
- P1: Always Study First
- P4: Always Ensure Quality

**For the complete framework, refer to the Operating System V2.0.**

---

## 1. Core Principles

### 1.1 Scientific Foundation is Mandatory

**Implements:** Operating System V2.0 - P4: Always Ensure Quality

**Every output MUST be scientifically grounded and factually correct.**

No "achismo" (guessing), no unfounded claims, no bullshit.

**MANDATORY STANDARD:**
- **ALWAYS seek scientific knowledge** (default behavior)
- **Scientific research MUST be quality research, not superficial** (deep, thorough, comprehensive)
- **ALL outputs must be scientifically grounded** (not optional)
- **AI University lessons MUST have quality bibliographic references** (non-negotiable)
- **Only skip research if cost optimization system explicitly blocks** (rare exception)

**Enforcement:**
- Level: CRITICAL - BLOCKING
- Target: ≥80% quality score
- Enforced by: `master_enforcer.py::check_quality_standards()`

---

### 1.2 Research is Default, Not Exception

**Implements:** Operating System V2.0 - P1: Always Study First

**Default behavior:**
```
Task received → Study internal knowledge → Research externally if needed
```

**NOT this:**
```
Task received → Look for reasons to skip research
```

**Research Sources (in order of preference):**
1. **Internal Knowledge** (0.5 credits) - Check first
2. **OpenAI API** (0.01 credits) - Use for general research
3. **Anna's Archive** (via search) - Use for academic papers
4. **Web Search** (20 credits) - Use for current data
5. **Browser** (30 credits) - Use for deep investigation

**Enforcement:**
- Level: CRITICAL - BLOCKING
- Target: 100% compliance
- Enforced by: `master_enforcer.py::check_study_phase()`

---

### 1.3 Quality Research, Not Superficial

**Implements:** Operating System V2.0 - P4: Always Ensure Quality

**Scientific research MUST be quality research:**

**NOT quality research:**
- Quick searches
- Reading only abstracts
- Single source
- Superficial understanding
- Uncritical acceptance

**Quality research:**
- Multiple authoritative sources (minimum 3)
- Deep reading and understanding
- Critical evaluation
- Cross-referencing
- Synthesis of knowledge
- Verification of claims

**The rule:** If doing research at all → Do quality research. Don't waste time and credits on superficial research.

---

### 1.4 Quality Over Cost for Permanent Knowledge

**When creating permanent knowledge (AI University lessons, protocols, documentation):**
- Quality is PRIORITY #1
- Cost is secondary
- Use Guardian validation (≥80% quality)
- Invest in thorough research
- Create lasting value

**When solving temporary tasks:**
- Balance quality and cost
- Use cost optimization
- Still maintain scientific standards
- But don't over-invest

[1]: Source Name, "Title", URL, Date
```

**Example:**
```markdown
According to the OpenAI documentation, GPT-4o costs $5 per 1M input tokens.[1]

```

---

### 3.3 Validation Requirements
