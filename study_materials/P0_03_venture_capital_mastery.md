## 1. CORE CONCEPTS

### VC Ecosystem

**Funding Stages:**

| Stage | Amount | Valuation | Purpose | Dilution |
|-------|--------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Pre-Seed** | $50K-$500K | $500K-$2M | MVP, validation | 10-20% |
| **Seed** | $500K-$2M | $2M-$10M | Product-market fit | 15-25% |
| **Series A** | $2M-$15M | $10M-$30M | Scale, revenue | 20-30% |
| **Series B** | $10M-$50M | $30M-$100M | Market expansion | 15-25% |
| **Series C+** | $50M+ | $100M+ | Dominance, IPO prep | 10-20% |

**Investor Types:**
- **Angels:** Individuals, $25K-$100K, high risk tolerance
- **Seed VCs:** Specialized funds, $500K-$2M
- **Growth VCs:** Later stage, $10M+, lower risk
- **Corporate VCs:** Strategic investors (e.g., mining companies for Intelltech)
- **PE Firms:** Buy-outs, mature companies

### Term Sheets & Valuation

**Key Terms:**

**1. Valuation:**
- **Pre-money:** Company value before investment
- **Post-money:** Pre-money + investment amount
- **Example:** $5M pre-money + $2M investment = $7M post-money
- **Investor ownership:** $2M / $7M = 28.6%

**2. Liquidation Preference:**
- **1x non-participating:** Get money back first, then share pro-rata
- **1x participating:** Get money back + pro-rata share (investor-friendly)
- **2x or 3x:** Multiple of investment back first (very investor-friendly)

**3. Anti-Dilution:**
- **Full Ratchet:** Protects investor if down round (founder-unfriendly)
- **Weighted Average:** Balanced protection (standard)

**4. Board Composition:**
- Common: 2 founders, 2 investors, 1 independent
- Control matters for key decisions

**5. Vesting:**
- Standard: 4 years, 1-year cliff
- Protects investors if founders leave

### Cap Tables & Dilution

**Example Cap Table Evolution:**

**Pre-Seed:**
- Founders: 90% (9M shares)
- Angels: 10% (1M shares)
- Total: 10M shares

**After Seed ($2M at $8M post-money):**
- Founders: 67.5% (9M shares)
- Angels: 7.5% (1M shares)
- Seed VC: 25% (3.33M shares)
- Total: 13.33M shares

**After Series A ($10M at $40M post-money):**
- Founders: 50.6%
- Angels: 5.6%
- Seed VC: 18.8%
- Series A VC: 25%
- Total: 16.67M shares

**Key Insight:** Founders typically own 40-60% by Series A, 20-40% by exit.

### Due Diligence Process

### Investor Targeting & Outreach

**Ideal Investor Profile for Intelltech:**

**Sector Focus:**
- Mining tech, industrial IoT, B2B SaaS
- Infrastructure, safety tech

**Stage Focus:**
- Seed to Series A ($1M-$10M)

**Geography:**
- APAC-focused or global with APAC presence

**Portfolio Fit:**
- Look for complementary companies (not direct competitors)

**Outreach Strategy:**

**1. Warm Introductions (Best):**
- Ask portfolio companies for intros
- Leverage advisors, board members
- Use LinkedIn connections

**2. Cold Email (If necessary):**
- Subject: "[Mutual Connection] recommended I reach out"
- Body: 2-3 sentences on traction, ask for 15-min call
- Attach 1-pager (not full deck)

**3. Events & Conferences:**
- Mining tech conferences
- VC pitch events
- Industry associations

**Timing:**
- Start 6-9 months before you need money
- Raise when you don't need it (position of strength)

### Negotiation Tactics

**Leverage Points:**

**1. Multiple Term Sheets:**
- Best leverage is competing offers
- Creates urgency, improves terms

**2. Strong Traction:**
- Revenue growth, customer logos
- Reduces risk, increases valuation

**3. Strategic Value:**
- Unique IP, key partnerships
- Differentiation from competitors

**What to Negotiate:**

| Term | Founder-Friendly | Investor-Friendly | Negotiable? |
|------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Valuation** | Higher | Lower | ✅ High |
| **Liquidation Pref** | 1x non-participating | 2-3x participating | ✅ Medium |
| **Board Seats** | Founder control | Investor control | ✅ High |
| **Anti-Dilution** | Weighted average | Full ratchet | ✅ Medium |
| **Vesting** | No acceleration | No acceleration | ❌ Low |

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
- Participating liquidation preference (especially with >1x)
- Full ratchet anti-dilution
- Investor board control before Series B
- Excessive protective provisions

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Raising Too Early:**
- Problem: Low valuation, high dilution
- Solution: Bootstrap to traction first

**2. Raising Too Late:**
- Problem: Running out of cash, desperate
- Solution: Start 6-9 months before you need it

**3. Optimistic Projections:**
- Problem: Lose credibility when you miss
- Solution: Conservative projections, beat them

**4. Ignoring Terms:**
- Problem: Focus only on valuation
- Solution: Terms matter as much as valuation

**5. No Plan B:**
- Problem: Single investor, no alternatives
- Solution: Always have multiple options
