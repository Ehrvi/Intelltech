# Content Marketing & Thought Leadership

## 1. Scientific Foundation

### Key Research Findings
Content marketing and thought leadership are pivotal in establishing brand authority and driving business growth. According to Pulizzi (2012), content marketing is a strategic approach focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly defined audience [1]. Thought leadership, as described by Barry and Gironda (2019), involves positioning a brand or individual as an authority in a specific domain through insightful and forward-thinking content [2].

### Theoretical Framework
The theoretical framework for content marketing and thought leadership is grounded in the diffusion of innovations theory (Rogers, 2003), which explains how new ideas and technologies spread within a culture [3]. This framework is complemented by the AIDA model (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action), which outlines the stages consumers go through before making a purchase decision [4].
