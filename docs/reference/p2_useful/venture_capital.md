### Theoretical Framework
The venture capital process can be understood through the lens of principal-agent theory, where venture capitalists (VCs) act as principals who provide capital and oversight, while entrepreneurs act as agents who manage the startup. This relationship is characterized by information asymmetry and risk, necessitating mechanisms such as staged financing, convertible securities, and active monitoring (Kaplan & Strömberg, 2001).

## 2. Practical Frameworks

### Framework 1: Pitch Deck Structure
- **Description**: A pitch deck is a presentation used by startups to communicate their business plan, vision, and financial needs to potential investors.
- **When to use**: During initial meetings with potential investors.
- **How to apply**: Include sections on problem, solution, market opportunity, business model, traction, team, and financials.
- **Example**: Airbnb's early pitch deck effectively communicated their value proposition and market potential, leading to successful fundraising.

### Framework 2: Financial Projections
- **Description**: Financial projections are estimates of future revenue, expenses, and cash flow.
- **When to use**: During the fundraising process to demonstrate financial viability.
- **How to apply**: Use historical data and market analysis to forecast revenue growth, cost structure, and profitability.
- **Example**: Dropbox used detailed financial projections to secure Series A funding by illustrating potential scalability.

## 3. Best Practices

### Practice 1: Valuation Methods
- **Scientific basis**: Damodaran, A. (2002). "Investment Valuation: Tools and Techniques for Determining the Value of Any Asset." *Wiley*.
- **Implementation steps**: Use methods like Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Comparable Company Analysis, and Precedent Transactions.
- **Common pitfalls**: Over-reliance on optimistic assumptions, ignoring market conditions.
- **Success metrics**: Accuracy of valuation in subsequent funding rounds or exit events.

### Practice 2: Term Sheets
- **Scientific basis**: Gompers, P., & Lerner, J. (2001). "The Money of Invention: How Venture Capital Creates New Wealth." *Harvard Business School Press*.
- **Implementation steps**: Negotiate terms such as valuation, liquidation preferences, and board composition.
- **Common pitfalls**: Overlooking the implications of anti-dilution clauses.
- **Success metrics**: Alignment of interests between founders and investors.

## 4. Tools & Techniques

- **Cap Table Management Tools**: Carta, Capshare. Use these tools to manage equity distribution and simulate dilution scenarios.
