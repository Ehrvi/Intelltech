### Theoretical Framework

Based on the resource-based view (RBV) and transaction cost economics (TCE), strategic partnerships are seen as mechanisms to access complementary resources and capabilities while minimizing transaction costs (Barney, J. B. 1991. "Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage." *Journal of Management*, 17(1), 99-120).
