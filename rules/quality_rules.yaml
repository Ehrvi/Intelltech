  excellent: 0.90    # Excellent quality benchmark
  perfect: 0.95      # Near-perfect quality

# Scientific method requirements
scientific_method:
  required: true
  elements:
    - hypothesis       # Clear statement of what we're investigating
    - methodology      # How we'll approach the problem
