# Cost thresholds in Manus credits
thresholds:
  low: 5          # Tasks under 5 credits
  medium: 20      # Tasks 5-20 credits
  high: 50        # Tasks 20-50 credits
  critical: 100   # Tasks over 100 credits (requires approval)

# Routing strategy: which tool to use first
routing:
  # Tasks that should try OpenAI first (cheaper, faster)
  openai_first:
    - research
    - analysis
    - writing
    - translation
    - code_generation
    - data_processing
    - summarization
    - question_answering
  
  # Tasks that MUST use Manus (no alternative)
  manus_only:
    - browser
    - mcp
    - file_ops
    - shell
    - slides
    - generate
    - webdev

# Cost multipliers (relative to baseline)
cost_multiplier:
  openai: 0.0001        # Extremely cheap
  manus_search: 10      # 10 credits per search
  manus_browser: 50     # 50 credits per browser session
  manus_parallel: 5     # 5 credits per parallel task
  manus_slides: 30      # 30 credits per slide generation

# Blocking rules
blocking:
  enabled: true
  block_if_cheaper_exists: true
  require_justification_above: 100  # Require justification for >100 credits

# Optimization strategies
optimization:
  cache_enabled: true
  batch_operations: true
  prefer_local_files: true
  avoid_redundant_searches: true
