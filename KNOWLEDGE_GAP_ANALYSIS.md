### 2.2. Areas of Competence (6.0/10)

MOTHER V4 has a functional, intermediate-level understanding of:

- **Sales & Business Development:** SPIN, Challenger Sale.
- **Psychology & Persuasion:** Cialdini's principles, cognitive biases.
- **Cultural Intelligence (APAC):** Hofstede's dimensions, Culture Map.
- **Economics & Finance:** NPV, IRR, TCO analysis.
- **Technology & Engineering (SHMS):** Geotechnical, structural, signal processing.
- **Strategic Planning:** Porter's 5 Forces, Blue Ocean.

## 3. Knowledge from Previous MOTHER Versions

### 3.1. Lost Knowledge Areas

Analysis of MOTHER V2 and V3 reports reveals a focus on **knowledge indexing and retrieval** that has been simplified in V4:

- **Vector Embeddings:** V2/V3 used vector embeddings for semantic search. V4 uses a simpler `grep` search.
- **Automated Knowledge Ingestion:** Previous versions had scripts to automatically ingest and index new documents.

**Recommendation:** Re-introduce these capabilities in MOTHER V4 to enhance knowledge management.

### 3.2. Deprecated Knowledge

- **Old file structures:** V3's 198-file structure is now obsolete.
- **Fragile scripts:** Many old scripts were unreliable and have been replaced.
