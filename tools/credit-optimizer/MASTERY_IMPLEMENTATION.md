# Mastery Implementation - Execution Plan

**Date:** 2026-02-16  
**Goal:** Achieve demonstrable mastery through systematic application  
**Approach:** Learn by doing, not by reading

---

## 🎯 MASTERY THROUGH APPLICATION

**Principle:** True mastery comes from applying knowledge, not accumulating it.

**Strategy:**
1. Identify what needs to be done (Mother optimization)
2. Learn what's needed to do it (just-in-time learning)
3. Apply immediately (practical mastery)
4. Measure results (validation)
5. Document learnings (knowledge capture)
