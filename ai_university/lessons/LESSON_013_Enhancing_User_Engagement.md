## Original Problem
**Context:**  
AI-generated content was consistently failing to engage users, resulting in low interaction rates and high bounce rates on digital platforms.

## Mistakes Made

## Quality Checklist
**Validation Steps:**  
- Conduct audience research to identify key interests and preferences.
- Implement A/B testing to determine which content variations perform best.
- Regularly review engagement metrics such as click-through rates, time on page, and bounce rates to inform content adjustments.
- Incorporate user feedback mechanisms, such as surveys or comments, to gather qualitative insights.
