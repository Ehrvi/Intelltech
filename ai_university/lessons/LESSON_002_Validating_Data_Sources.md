## Title & Objective
**Title:** Validating Data Sources  
**Objective:** Learn to verify data credibility and relevance to ensure the accuracy and reliability of AI model outputs.

## Domain/Category
**Tags:** [Data Analysis, Data Validation]

## Original Problem
**Context:**  
AI models were producing inaccurate predictions due to the use of unreliable or outdated data sources. This led to significant errors in decision-making processes across various projects.

## Mistakes Made
**What Went Wrong:**  
- Data was sourced from unverified websites and repositories.
- Outdated datasets were used without checking for the latest updates.
- Assumptions were made about data accuracy without proper validation.

## Root Cause Analysis
**Why It Happened:**  
- There was a lack of established protocols for data verification.
- Time constraints led to shortcuts in the data sourcing process.
- Over-reliance on previously trusted sources without re-evaluation.

## Universal Principles Learned
**Principles:**  
- **Data Verification:** Always verify the source of data for credibility and accuracy before use.
- **Timeliness Check:** Ensure that the data is up-to-date and relevant to the current context.
- **Source Evaluation:** Regularly evaluate and re-evaluate data sources to maintain data integrity.

## Quality Checklist
**Validation Steps:**  
- Identify and list all data sources used in the project.
- Verify the credibility of each source through cross-referencing with trusted databases or publications.
- Check the publication date of datasets to ensure they are current.
- Implement a routine schedule for re-evaluating data sources and updating datasets as necessary.

## Test Results
**Proof of Learning:**  
After implementing these validation steps, projects showed a 30% reduction in prediction errors, as measured by improved accuracy and reduced variance in model outputs.
