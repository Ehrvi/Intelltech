# Lesson 01: Cost Optimization

## Principle
Always use the cheapest tool that can achieve the required quality.

## Decision Tree
1. Can OpenAI do this? → YES: Use OpenAI (cheap)
2. Does it require browser/MCP/files? → YES: Use Manus
3. Is quality ≥80%? → YES: Accept, NO: Escalate

## Examples
- Text generation: OpenAI ✓
- Web scraping: Manus (browser) ✓
- Code generation: OpenAI first, validate quality
- File operations: Manus ✓

## Target
75-90% cost savings while maintaining quality
